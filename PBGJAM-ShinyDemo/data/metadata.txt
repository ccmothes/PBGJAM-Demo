Metadata for PBGJAM Shinyapp

Habitat_visualization.rds: All the pngs for the gapfraction and terrain.
Traits.csv: code 6 is the species code name for the element in the list, you can match its genus, full species name, family, and tribe using different columns.
	UPDATE: species_names: fixed NA's/duplicates. now 216 unique species names with Tribe

data4CaitlinV2.rds: Units for all (except gap fraction) are counts/trap night
	Plot.ID :         name of the plot that match with the data/coordinate I send you before
	S1:               abundance change for SSP245 (hisoric - 208.21)
	S2:               abundance change for SSP585 (historic - 208.21)
	Gap.frac.10: 	  gap fraction by plot
	Tmean.JJA:   	 temperature in summer
	S1.mainT:     	main effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP245
	S2.mainT:    	main effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP585
	S1.fullT:        full effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP245
	S2.fullT:        full effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP585
	NOTE: S1 = historic - 208.21 SSP245 and S2 = historic - 208.21 SSP585
	
Data4Caitlinv3.rds: All the (historical) covariates used to train the model. (climate + habitat)
	Gap.frac.10: gap fraction
	s.roughness: surface roughness
	Nitrogen.mean: canopy nitrogen
	Cec30: cation exchange capacity
	Nrd.15cm.2m: understory density
	CwdVolume.sqrt: coarse woody debris
	Def.JJA: summer moisture deficit (from June, July, and August)
	Tmean.JJA: summer temperature (from June, July, and August)

Data4Caitlinv4.rds: Modeled abundance for each time/climate scenario. The column is named like: ssp245_2021.204_normal, where ssp245 is the scenario, 2021.204 is the time interval for 2021-2040. It will be three time interval and one historical time interval in total.  
	Time frames: histrical (current), 2021-2040; 2061-2080; 2081-2100.
	
Data4CaitlinV5.rds: Future climate variables for summer temp and summer deficit for 3 time frames/scenario
