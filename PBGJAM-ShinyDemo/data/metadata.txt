Metadata for PBGJAM Shinyapp

Data4Caitlinv4.rds: same as before, it will be a list with species. The column is named like: ssp245_2021.204_normal, where ssp245 is the scenario, 2021.204 is the time interval for 2021-2040. It will be three time interval and one historical time interval in total.  
Data4Caitlinv3.rds: it contains all the covariates we have for the model. (climate + habitat)
Habitat_visualization.rds: it contains all the pngs for the gapfraction and terrain.
Traits.csv: code 6 is the species code name for the element in the list, you can match its genus, full species name, family, and tribe using different columns.
data4Caitlinv2.rds: 
	Plot.ID :         name of the plot that match with the data/coordinate I send you before
	S1:               abundance change for SSP245
	S2:               abundance change for SSP585
	Gap.frac.10: 	gap fraction by plot
	Tmean.JJA:   temperature in summer
	S1.mainT:     main effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP245
	S2.mainT:     main effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP585
	S1.fullT:        full effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP245
	S2.fullT:        full effects of temperature on abundance change for SSP585
